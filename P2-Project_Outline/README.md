## Submission Instructions

### Overview

#POLY is a web app that reads news articles and grades them based on factuality and bias. 
#Users will input the URL of an article when they are curious about it's validity. 
#Using algorithms that identify biased language, primary vs secondary sources, and hisotrically factual journalism, 
#POLY can give users a general idea of how trustworthy an article can be. 
#POLY was inspired by my own experiences with misinformation and biased journalism,
#as well as a desire to hold platforms accountable for hosting misinformation.
#The goal of the POLY web app is to make it easier for everyone to have access to the truth. 

### Features

#1. Web Parsing: Using the Mercury API, POLY can parse the article text from the rest of the web page, as well as the date it was published. 
#Then, POLY identifies links and keywords from the text and compares them to the database. 

#2. Grading: Based on the information POLY finds from the text, a grade will be generated (0-100) giving users an idea of how trsutworthy this article could be. 
#This information will be displayed on the webpage with a description of how to score is generated. 

#3. Validation: POLY can identify when it is given a link that it can't read. POLY won't be able to read articles that are
#behind a pay wall, nor will it be able to grade web pages that do not have a body of text. 
#POLY will be able to read things like blog posts. POLY can also give overall grades for a news source as a whole,
#as long as that news source appears on the database.
