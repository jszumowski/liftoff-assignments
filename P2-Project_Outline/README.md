# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

## POLY is a web app that reads news articles and grades them based on factuality and bias. 
## Users will input the URL of an article when they are curious about it's validity. 
## Using algorithms that identify biased language, primary vs secondary sources, and hisotrically factual journalism, 
## POLY can give users a general idea of how trustworthy an article can be. 
## POLY was inspired by my own experiences with misinformation and biased journalism,
## as well as a desire to hold platforms accountable for hosting misinformation.
## The goal of the POLY web app is to make it easier for everyone to have access to the truth. 

### Features

#1. Web Parsing: Using the Mercury API, POLY can parse the article text from the rest of the web page, as well as the date it was published. 
#                Then, POLY identifies links and keywords from the text and compares them to the database. 

#2. Grading: Based on the information POLY finds from the text, a grade will be generated (0-100) giving users an idea of how trsutworthy this article could be. 
#            This information will be displayed on the webpage with a description of how to score is generated. 

#3. Validation: POLY can identify when it is given a link that it can't read. POLY won't be able to read articles that are
#               behind a pay wall, nor will it be able to grade web pages that do not have a body of text. 
#               POLY will be able to read things like blog posts. POLY can also give overall grades for a news source as a whole,
#               as long as that news source appears on the database.
